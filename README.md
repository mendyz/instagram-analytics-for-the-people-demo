# Social Media Analytics for the People

I started this project because of a lack of available metrics from existing tools.

As we grew and had more brands to support across our organization, I had to build a social media marketing team and integrate all the associated technologies to support them. So, I set up a tech stack I thought would work, and sort of assumed with Buffer or Sprout (etc.) there would be reporting to go with it. Unfortunately, this is not _exactly_ the case. Sprout is pretty good, but only if you've been collecting data with it in the past. So, if you sign up with sprout or buffer in November 2018 hoping to get your year-end 2018 analytics, you're out of luck!  This is actually exactly what happened to me, so I decided to dive into my coder self a bit for this project. 

This Jupyter Notebook uses:
- `pandas`
- `racerga/instagram-scraper`
- `matplotlib`
